### Project: Application Log Analysis
*_Goal_*: Parse a log file to identify the number of each type of log entry (e.g., ERROR, WARN, INFO) and output a report summarizing these counts.

*Step 1*: Sample Log File Creation  
Provide a sample log file, application.log,   which students will analyze.

Sample application.log Content:
```log
2024-10-30 10:15:32 [INFO] Application started
2024-10-30 10:16:35 [ERROR] Failed to connect to database
2024-10-30 10:17:42 [WARN] Low memory
2024-10-30 10:18:45 [INFO] User logged in
2024-10-30 10:20:55 [ERROR] File not found
2024-10-30 10:21:33 [INFO] Data saved successfully
2024-10-30 10:22:41 [WARN] Disk usage high
```
Step 2: Script to Parse the Log File  
*File*: parse_logs.sh
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Path to the log file
LOG_FILE="application.log"

# Check if the log file exists
if [[ ! -f "$LOG_FILE" ]]; then
  echo "Log file not found!"
  exit 1
fi

# Initialize counters for each log level
info_count=0
warn_count=0
error_count=0

# Read the log file line by line
while IFS= read -r line; do
  # Check for each log level and update counters
  if [[ "$line" == *"[INFO]"* ]]; then
    ((info_count++))
  elif [[ "$line" == *"[WARN]"* ]]; then
    ((warn_count++))
  elif [[ "$line" == *"[ERROR]"* ]]; then
    ((error_count++))
  fi
done < "$LOG_FILE"

# Output the results
echo "Log Analysis Report"
echo "--------------------"
echo "INFO count : $info_count"
echo "WARN count : $warn_count"
echo "ERROR count: $error_count"
```

Step 3: Run the Script  
Make the script executable and run it:
```bash
chmod +x parse_logs.sh
./parse_logs.sh
```
*Expected Output*
When students run the script, they should see output similar to this:
```
Log Analysis Report
--------------------
INFO count : 3
WARN count : 2
ERROR count: 2
```

### Task 2: Parsing a JSON Log File
*Goal*: Teach students how to process JSON   files in Bash, focusing on extracting values, counting occurrences, and summarizing data.  

#### Step 1: Sample JSON Log File Creation  
Provide a sample JSON log file, activity_log.json, for students to analyze.  

Sample activity_log.json Content:
```log 
[
  {"timestamp": "2024-10-30T09:00:01Z", "userID": 12345, "action": "login", "status": "success"},
  {"timestamp": "2024-10-30T09:05:32Z", "userID": 12345, "action": "view_page", "status": "success"},
  {"timestamp": "2024-10-30T09:10:45Z", "userID": 67890, "action": "login", "status": "failed"},
  {"timestamp": "2024-10-30T09:12:15Z", "userID": 67890, "action": "view_page", "status": "success"},
  {"timestamp": "2024-10-30T09:15:30Z", "userID": 12345, "action": "logout", "status": "success"},
  {"timestamp": "2024-10-30T09:20:01Z", "userID": 67890, "action": "logout", "status": "failed"},
  {"timestamp": "2024-10-30T09:22:11Z", "userID": 12345, "action": "upload_file", "status": "success"},
  {"timestamp": "2024-10-30T09:25:55Z", "userID": 67890, "action": "upload_file", "status": "success"},
  {"timestamp": "2024-10-30T09:30:01Z", "userID": 67890, "action": "delete_file", "status": "success"},
  {"timestamp": "2024-10-30T09:35:15Z", "userID": 12345, "action": "view_page", "status": "failed"}
]
```
#### Step 2: Script to Parse the JSON File
Students can use the jq command-line tool to parse the JSON data. Ensure that they have jq installed. Here's the script they will create.

File: parse_json_log.sh
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Path to the JSON log file
JSON_FILE="activity_log.json"

# Check if the JSON file exists
if [[ ! -f "$JSON_FILE" ]]; then
  echo "JSON file not found! Please ensure that '$JSON_FILE' exists."
  exit 1
fi

# Initialize counters
success_count=0
failed_count=0

# Read the JSON file and count successes and failures
success_count=$(jq '[.[] | select(.status == "success")] | length' "$JSON_FILE")
failed_count=$(jq '[.[] | select(.status == "failed")] | length' "$JSON_FILE")

# Output the results
echo "JSON Log Analysis Report"
echo "------------------------"
echo "Total Success Actions: $success_count"
echo "Total Failed Actions  : $failed_count"

# Save the report to a file
REPORT_FILE="json_log_analysis_report.txt"
{
  echo "JSON Log Analysis Report"
  echo "------------------------"
  echo "Total Success Actions: $success_count"
  echo "Total Failed Actions  : $failed_count"
} > "$REPORT_FILE"

echo "Report saved to '$REPORT_FILE'."
```
#### Step 3: Run the Script
Make the script executable and run it:
```bash
chmod +x parse_json_log.sh
./parse_json_log.sh
```
#### Expected Output
When students run the script, they should see output similar to this:
```log 
JSON Log Analysis Report
------------------------
Total Success Actions: 6
Total Failed Actions  : 3
Report saved to 'json_log_analysis_report.txt'.
```

#### Explanation of Extended Log Entries
Diverse Actions: The log includes various actions (login, view_page, logout, upload_file, delete_file) to provide a broad spectrum for analysis.  
Multiple Statuses: Each action has a status of either success or failed, allowing for a detailed count and analysis of successful versus failed actions.  
Timestamp: Each entry includes a timestamp, which is useful for temporal analysis, such as counting actions within specific time frames.   
Suggested Extensions for the Analysis Script
Count Actions by User: Modify the script to count the number of actions performed by each user and print that information in the report.   

Filter by User ID: Allow users to input a specific user ID when running the script to filter the report to that userâ€™s actions.   

Detailed Report of Failed Attempts: Extend the report to include timestamps and actions for all failed attempts, presenting them in a list format.
